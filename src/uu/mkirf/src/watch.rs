//! `--watch` mode: rebuild the initramfs whenever the source tree changes.
//!
//! `/boot/initramfs/` is meant to behave like an ordinary directory
//! — edit a file in it and the initramfs is current again, with no
//! rebuild command and no coupling to the package manager. The watcher
//! is what makes that true.
//!
//! mkirf in watch mode is a foreground loop: it runs until killed.
//! Supervising and restarting it is a service manager's job, not
//! mkirf's (boot-design.md §3.5, §5.9). A rebuild that fails is logged
//! but does not stop the watch, so fixing the offending file recovers
//! on the next change.
